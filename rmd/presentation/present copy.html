# OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS PROPOSITION


We are trying to accurately model the price of wine utilizing several variables connected with the winemaking process.  In this dataset, the majority of the wines surveyed fall below $100, but there are notable exceptions.  This sort of model has many applications that can be directly applied to numerous businesses and ventures.  Below are some industries and vocations that could benefit from such a model. Examples of potential use cases are:

- Restaurant Owner: Sell Wine For Larger Markup
- Wine Speculator: Naturally Can Make Bigger Profits
- Wine Distributor: Can Know What Wines Not To Sell
- Winery Owner:  Shift Focus To Higher Margin Grape Varieties

# KAGGLE

#### The original [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) included 14 coulmns 

.pull-left[
- `#`: A numeric id from 0-130,000
- `country`: The country that the wine originated
- `description`: The body of the review
- `designation`: The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from, ie: Reserve Harvest
- `points`: The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100*
- `price`: The cost in USD for one bottle
- `province`: The province or state that the wine originated
- `region_1`: The wine-growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
]
.pull-right[
- `region_2`: Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine-growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
- `taster_name`: The name of the reviewer
- `taster_twitter_handle`: The twitter handle of the reviewer
- `title`: The title of the wine
- `variety`: The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
- `winery`: The winery that made the wine
]

.footnote[&lt;i class="fad fa-asterisk"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The lowest score in the data set was 80]

class: twitter

# TWITTER

- We pulled data from the twitter profiles of each of the reviewers like gender, amount of tweets, number of followers, etc. 
- The underlying assumption is that reviewers who were prolific on social media might be more generous with their assigned points than those who weren’t.
- Additionally, they may behave differently on gender lines.

class: wine-color

# WINE COLOR

- The original data set included the variety of the grape but not the color of the wine. 
- A group of colors was assigned via regular expressions ie: all varieties matching `REGEX` were classified as red. Validation was done of each of the matches to make sure there were no false positives.
- The rest was done manually with the aid of a google sheet document that auto-populated with thumbnails from google image search. Afterward, this data was imported and left joined to the data set.

.center[ ![](http://garretthawes.com/color-class_2.gif) ]

---

# DATA CLEANING

- Various encoding issues were fixed with the text columns, NA values were removed from price and columns were converted to character where blank implies that there was none (ie: designation).
- Wines with missing countries were removed, as were wines missing a grape varietal and taster name.
- Some columns were converted to charecter vectors to make them easier to work with.


```r
wine_data &lt;- wine_data %&gt;% 
  dplyr::mutate( country = as.character(country), 
                 variety = as.character(variety), 
                 taster_name = as.character(taster_name), 
                 color_lump = fct_lump(color, n = 2), 
                 province_lump = fct_lump(province, n = 25), 
                 country_lump = fct_lump(country, n = 25) ) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::filter (country != "" &amp; variety != "" &amp; taster_name != "") %&gt;% drop_na(price) 
```

class: features
# FEATURE GENERATION

#### Several columns were added to help get a better picture of the data.

- Reviews were grouped by points into "Not Recommended", "Mediocre", "Good", "Very good", "Outstanding” and "Classic” as per the wine spectator website. 
- Sentiment Analysis was performed on the title of the wine
- Additional title-based features included number of characters, number of words and whether the title included any accents (as a metric of whether the wine seemed exotic and foreign in the American market).
- Wine designation was grouped into more broad categories ie: any wine that included a variation of the word reserve(reserva, riserva, reserve, estate reserve, etc…) were renamed reserve this was done with the aid of `grepl`, `stringr` and `stringi`. `wordcloud` was useds to identify target groups.

# FEATURE GENERATION

- `n` for `fct_lump` for the various factor columns according to a parameter set at the beginning of main.R or on the command line. 
- Parameters are `by_count`, `taster_name`, `taster_twitter`, `designation`, `country`, `variety`, `variety.red`, `variety.white`, `province`, `winery`


```r
FCT_LUMPS &lt;- list( by_count = 0, ..., winery = 15)
```

- `by_count` supersedes the other parameters in that setting it will cause `fct_lump` based on how many observations there are with any given feature.


```r
if (FCT_LUMPS$by_count != 0) {
  fct_x &lt;- .number_of_factor_levels_containing_num_observations 
  FCT_LUMPS[['taster_name']] &lt;-
    fct_x(wine_data$taster_name, FCT_LUMPS$by_count)
  FCT_LUMPS[['taster_twitter']] &lt;-
    fct_x(wine_data$taster_twitter_handle, FCT_LUMPS$by_count)

- Distribution of price is not well distributed in the original data as you can see from the previous slide, scaling the price to log base 10 with `scale_y_log10` and `coord_flip()` taking the log of price makes the data more reasonable.

ggplot(wine_data_clean, aes(x = country_lump,

# DATA PRE-PROCESSING

- The preprocess function in `CARET` was used to transform independent numeric values into more standardized variables 



```r
wine_data_to_be_standardized &lt;- wine_data_clean %&gt;% 
  select( points, title.n_words, title.sentement, title.n_chars, taster.avg_points, 
          taster.n_reviews, taster.n_tweets, taster.n_followers)
preprocessParams &lt;-

print(preprocessParams)

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

# TEST/TRAIN SPLIT

- The createDataPartition function of caret was used to create balanced test and training sets including 75% and 25% of the data respectively
- Specifically, price was broken into 5 groups and data was sampled by group to ensure an even distribution.


```r
set.seed(1861)
options(scipen = 50)
TRAIN.PERCENT &lt;- 0.75 
*inTrainSetIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(y = wine_data_standardized$price,

- Due to time and computing constraints, the accuracy of this model is distorted since ~50% of the observations got no prediction
- Bootstrap prediction have narrower distribution than actual: have less variance
- Bootstrap predictions have a bias to the left of actual price distribution
- Hence this bootstrap model will tend to show lower than actual price for wine (i.e. undervalue wine)
- From the review of a number of the decision trees we see that most root and decision nodes use `points` for decision to split, then `taster.avg_points` and `variety` are used.

# RANDOM FOREST - GINI COEFFICIENT

# RANDOM FOREST - SUMMARY

.pull-left[
- Similar to the bootstrap model Points, scoring mean minimal depth of only 1.1 and having significantly larger % increase in both MSE and Node Purity than other parameters, are the most important factor in modeling `\(-1 \cdot price^{-0.3}\)`
- Variables `country`, `taster.avg_points` and `color` appear to also strengthen the model with mean minimal depth below 2, but less impressive % increase in MSE (except for color) and Node Purity. 
- All parameters tied to title appear to have much less impact, and price is pretty much not impacted by accents in the title
- An `\(r^2\)` of .5987 implies that the model explains ~ 60% of the variation in our data.

- Determining whether the wine is a “good value” better than chance
- AUC values are high, above 80% or about 70% higher than chance
- AUC for train and test  nearly identical hence model neither over- or underfit
- Points, Specific Province, Specific Variety, Specific Winery, followed by Specific Taster explain the model best whereas Title information not so much

``` r 
well_priced ~ points.category + country + province + winery + 
    color + variety + designation + title.has_accents + 
    taster.name + taster.gender + title.n_words + title.sentement + 
    title.n_chars + taster.avg_points + taster.n_reviews + taster.n_tweets + 
    taster.n_followers
    ```

# FURTHER WORK

### Various other candidate models were looked at that would be interesting to work with

- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Neural Networks**
- **K Nearest Neighbors**
- **Bayesian Additive Regression Trees** mostly because the R package is called bartMachine

#### Additionally we would like to delve deeper into the capabilities of the `caret` package specifically hyperparameter tuning and model comparison as well as using `caretEnsemble` to run a composite model.
