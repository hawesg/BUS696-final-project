## Garrett, Ricky, Bart

This is the the project files for our BUS 696 Final project working with the data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews 

The code is organized in this structure:

1. [code](code): a folder to store code for processing data
2. [data](data): a folder to store input and output data
3. [images](images): a folder to store images produced for reporting
4. [rmd](rmd): a folder containing the files used to generate both the original writeup as well as the presentation
4. [rmd/README.Rmd](rmd/README.Rmd): This is a a R file used to produce the
`README.md` file.
5. [README.md](README.md): This is a tl:dr of the analysis pdf file.
6. [main.R](main.R): This is the main R file. It lists the steps for the analysis
7. [run.sh](run.sh): This is the bash file that will automatically run 'main.R' when invoked.

**Please see additional readme files in the various folders**

This was going to contain a report on the project however the paper component of the assignement was waived so the only two deliverables are the [writeup on data preperation](http://bus696.garretthawes.com/deliverable-2/index.html) and the [main presentation](http://bus696.garretthawes.com/present.html). Both were weiten in rmarkdown.
