# Colors

# scale: Indicates the range of sizes of the words.
# max.words: Plots the specified number of words and discard least frequent terms.]
# min.freq: Discards all terms whose frequency is below the specified value.
# random.order: By setting this to false, we make it so that the words with the highest frequency are plotted first. If we donâ€™t set this, it will plot the words in a random order and the highest frequency words may not necessarily appear in the center.
# rot.per: Determines the fraction of words that are plotted vertically.
# colors: The default value is black. If you want to use different colors based on frequency, you can specify a vector of colors or use one of the pre-defined color palettes.
